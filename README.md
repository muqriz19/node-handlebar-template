# NodeJS Handlebars Template

Simple nodejs with handlebar js as its view engine to serve site

Uses gulp to start server and watch out for changes - should reload browser if changes appear.
TBH my gulpFile is somewhat messy and unknown, dont really know if this was the proper way to set it up. But for my usecase its works as intended.
Will update more as I learn and get fimilar with it.
